Three libraries of pythons
1. Numpy
2. Pandas
3. Matplotlib

	Numpy:- When we want to play with Numbers using pythons
	Use :- 1. Numpy provides efficient storage
		   2. Provide better ways for handing data
		   3. It is very fast
		   4. It is very easy to learn
		   5. It uses relatively less memory to store the data
		   
	Pandas:- It is an open source data analysis library written in python.
			 It provide rich and highly robust data opertation
	
Day 3 :-

Machine learning
1. Supervised
2. Unsupervised
3. Reinforcement


1. Supervised-
	1. Classification - true/false
			    male/female
			    apple/banana
	2. Regression - predicting anu continuous value
		        for ex: 10k,12k,13k.......
				age.......................


Algo:-  1. Logestic Regression - classification
        2. Linear Regression - regression 
	3. Svm - support verctor machine - Both classifier and regression
	4. Random forest - Both classifier and regression	


Linear Regreesion
	Linear : Straight
	Regression: When we predict a continuous value

AIM:- To find the best fit line with minimal residual error
 

What is the equation of line ?
	
y = mx + c

y - predicted value
m - slope
x - input value
c - intercept  


We will define a Cost function to get the bestfit Line
 
	       m	    ^	    2
j(m,c) = lamda 1/2m(Yi - Y1)
